That Table 17.20.030, Parking Requirements, in Section 17.20.030 of the Metropolitan Code is hereby amended as shown in Exhibit A. Section 2.

This Ordinance shall take effect upon publication of above said notice announcing such change in a newspaper of general circulation, the welfare of The Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County requiring it. Agenda Analysis Analysis This ordinance amends Section 17.20.030 of the Metropolitan Code to eliminate the minimum parking requirements for the “bar or nightclub” land use. Currently, one parking space for every 75 square feet of floor area is required for the “bar and nightclub” use outside of the Urban Zoning Overlay District (UZO). There is not a minimum parking requirement inside of the UZO, but rather a maximum parking allowance for the “bar or nightclub” use of one parking space for every 75 square feet of floor area. The ordinance proposes to remove the minimum parking requirements for the “bar or nightclub” use for properties outside of the UZO. The maximum parking allowance for the “bar or nightclub” use within the UZO would be maintained and unchanged. There would be no maximum parking allowance for the “bar or nightclub” use outside of the UZO. This item was recommended for approval by the Planning Commission (7-0) at their July 24, 2025, meeting.
